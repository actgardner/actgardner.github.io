I love learning new technologies and solving interesting problems. Right now I'm focused on the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Kafka, distributed systems, and systems programmming.

I also present at conferences - including Big Data Montreal, Hadoop Summit San Jose, and DataEngConf NYC - and organize the Big Data Ottawa meetup. 

Recent convert to Golang.
